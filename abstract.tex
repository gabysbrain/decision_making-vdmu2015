In this position paper we investigate the link between the various decision 
making heuristics identified by the cognitive science 
community~\citep{Payne:1993} and the tasks and mantras commonly quoted in
the visualization community. We identify the use of many of these heuristics
in the parameter space analysis papers listed in Sedlmair et 
al.~\citep{Sedlmair:2014}. Based on these results, we then also propose three 
questions for further discussion and research: what are common decision 
making strategies, how can current approaches of task taxonomies and mantras 
be reconciled under the lens of decision making, and how we can better 
support different decision making/problem solving strategies in our tools?
