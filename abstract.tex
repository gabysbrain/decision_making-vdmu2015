In this position paper we investigate the role of decision 
making in uncertainty visualization.
%and the tasks and mantras commonly quoted in
%the visualization community. We identify the use of many of these heuristics
We introduce common decision making strategies identified by the cognitive science 
community~\citep{Payne:1993}. These strategies are then used  to reanalyze 
21 design study papers that have previously been used as a foundation for
defining visual parameter space analysis~\citep{Sedlmair:2014}. 
We found that current strategies in these tools relied mostly on
one parameter at a time and are about filtering alternatives.
Based on these results, we  propose three questions for further discussion and research.
%Based on these results, we then also propose three 
%questions for further discussion and research: what are common decision 
%making strategies, how can current approaches of task taxonomies and mantras 
%be reconciled under the lens of decision making, and how we can better 
%support different decision making/problem solving strategies in our tools?
